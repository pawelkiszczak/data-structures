    "One important variation of a queue is called a <b>priority queue</b>.<br>\n",
    "This kind of queue acts like a queue in which you dequeue an intem by removing it from front. However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is determind by their priotity.<br><br>\n",
    "The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the lowest priority items are at the back. When you enqueue an item on a priority queue, the new item may move all the way to the front.<br><br>\n",
    "A classic way to implement a priority queue is using a data structure called a <b>binary heap</b>. This solution will allow to both enqueue and dequeue items in O(logn) time."
